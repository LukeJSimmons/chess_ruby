## Background
This project was built as part of The Odin Project Ruby course. My goal in making it is to expand my knowledge and hands-on experience with Ruby.
## Lessons Learned
This project completely changed how I think about programming.

In projects past, I've had a very "Code first, think later" strategy. I would tell myself the best way to learn was to do it along the way.

Not true at all.

This project went so smoothly because I didn't code first. Before I wrote a single line of code, I spent hours brainstorming on a whiteboard.

Even after I finished brainstorming I spent even more hours translating my ideas into a clear timeline of tasks and requirements.

This structure laid a perfect foundation for TDD and OOP. Instead of writing spaghetti code and patching it up later, I used my time and my code wisely.

Not to say I kept to this perfectly. There are definitely some spots that need reworking. However, I am more than proud of this game and the learning experience it has been.

Thank you chess.
